  <h5>关于Sample Test样式的问题</h5>
  <p>目前我是直接用的pygments bash类型来对test进行处理，实际上我觉得input和output如果能带上颜色，那么会更直观一些。</p>
  <p>如果有人对<a href="http://pygments.org/" target=_blank>Hacking For Pygments</a>感兴趣，可以试着增加对input和output的过滤识别并上色，或者也可以试着尝试一下pygments支持的哪种语言可以对其上色。</p>

# 149A Business trip

<blockquote>
<p>What joy! Petya's parents went on a business trip for the whole year and the playful kid is left all by himself. Petya got absolutely happy. He jumped on the bed and threw pillows all day long, until...</p>

<p>Today Petya opened the cupboard and found a scary note there. His parents had left him with duties: he should water their favourite flower all year, each day, in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. "Wait a second!" — thought Petya. He know for a fact that if he fulfills the parents' task in the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ 12) month of the year, then the flower will grow by ai centimeters, and if he doesn't water the flower in the i-th month, then the flower won't grow this month. Petya also knows that try as he might, his parents won't believe that he has been watering the flower if it grows strictly less than by k centimeters.</p>

<p>Help Petya choose the minimum number of months when he will water the flower, given that the flower should grow no less than by k centimeters.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains exactly one integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 100). The next line contains twelve space-separated integers: the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ 12) number in the line represents ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the only integer — the minimum number of months when Petya has to water the flower so that the flower grows no less than by k centimeters. If the flower can't grow by k centimeters in a year, print -1.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
Let's consider the first sample test. There it is enough to water the flower during the seventh and the ninth month. Then the flower grows by exactly five centimeters.

In the second sample Petya's parents will believe him even if the flower doesn't grow at all (k = 0). So, it is possible for Petya not to water the flower at all.

# 41A Translation

<blockquote>
<p>The translation from the Berland language into the Birland language is not an easy task. Those languages are very similar: a berlandish word differs from a birlandish word with the same meaning a little: it is spelled (and pronounced) reversely. For example, a Berlandish word code corresponds to a Birlandish word edoc. However, it's easy to make a mistake during the «translation». Vasya translated word s from Berlandish into Birlandish as t. Help him: find out if he translated the word correctly.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains word s, the second line contains word t. The words consist of lowercase Latin letters. The input data do not consist unnecessary spaces. The words are not empty and their lengths do not exceed 100 symbols.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
If the word t is a word s, written reversely, print YES, otherwise print NO.

# 278A Circle Line


><p>The circle line of the Berland subway has n stations. We know the distances between all pairs of neighboring stations:</p>

>* d1 is the distance between the 1-st and the 2-nd station;
* d2 is the distance between the 2-nd and the 3-rd station;<br>
...<br>
* dn - 1 is the distance between the n - 1-th and the n-th station;
* dn is the distance between the n-th and the 1-st station.

>The trains go along the circle line in both directions. Find the shortest distance between stations with numbers s and t.

><strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of stations on the circle line. The second line contains n integers d1, d2, ..., dn (1 ≤ di ≤ 100) — the distances between pairs of neighboring stations. The third line contains two integers s and t (1 ≤ s, t ≤ n) — the numbers of stations, between which you need to find the shortest distance. These numbers can be the same.

>The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print a single number — the length of the shortest path between stations number s and t.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>

>*   In the first sample the length of path 1 → 2 → 3 equals 5, the length of path 1 → 4 → 3 equals 13.
*   In the second sample the length of path 4 → 1 is 100, the length of path 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 is 15.
*   In the third sample the length of path 3 → 1 is 1, the length of path 3 → 2 → 1 is 2.
*   In the fourth sample the numbers of stations are the same, so the shortest distance equals 0.

# 270A Fancy Fence

><p>Emuskald needs a fence around his farm, but he is too lazy to build it himself. So he purchased a fence-building robot.</p>
><p>He wants the fence to be a regular polygon. The robot builds the fence along a single path, but it can only make fence corners at a single angle a.</p>
><p>Will the robot be able to build the fence Emuskald wants? In other words, is there a regular polygon which angles are equal to a?</p>

><strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line of input contains an integer t (0 < t < 180) — the number of tests. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer a (0 < a < 180) — the angle the robot can make corners at measured in degrees.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
For each test, output on a single line "YES" (without quotes), if the robot can build a fence Emuskald wants, and "NO" (without quotes), if it is impossible.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first test case, it is impossible to build the fence, since there is no regular polygon with angle .<br>
In the second test case, the fence is a regular triangle, and in the last test case — a square.

# 344A Magnets

>Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He doesn't need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each magnet has two poles, positive (a "plus") and negative (a "minus"). If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.
>
>Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own.

>Mike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that the magnets formed.
![](http://espresso.codeforces.com/1080bca1bfd4fb588982bdc5c23614cd5143cd30.png)
<br>
><strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the number of magnets. Then n lines follow. The i-th line (1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains either characters "01", if Mike put the i-th magnet in the "plus-minus" position, or characters "10", if Mike put the magnet in the "minus-plus" position.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
On the single line of the output print the number of groups of magnets.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
The first testcase corresponds to the figure. The testcase has three groups consisting of three, one and two magnets.

# 313A Ilya and Bank Account

>Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In this city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.

>Ilya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once. For example, if the state of Ilya's bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.

>Ilya is not very good at math, and that's why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank's gift.
<br>
><strong>Input</strong><br>
The single line contains integer n (10 ≤ |n| ≤ 10**9) — the state of Ilya's bank account.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
In a single line print an integer — the maximum state of the bank account that Ilya can get.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first test sample Ilya doesn't profit from using the present.

>In the second test sample you can delete digit 1 and get the state of the account equal to 0.

# 158C Cd and pwd commands

>Vasya is writing an operating system shell, and it should have commands for working with directories. To begin with, he decided to go with just two commands: cd (change the current directory) and pwd (display the current directory).

>Directories in Vasya's operating system form a traditional hierarchical tree structure. There is a single root directory, denoted by the slash character "/". Every other directory has a name — a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Each directory (except for the root) has a parent directory — the one that contains the given directory. It is denoted as "..".

>The command cd takes a single parameter, which is a path in the file system. The command changes the current directory to the directory specified by the path. The path consists of the names of directories separated by slashes. The name of the directory can be "..", which means a step up to the parent directory. «..» can be used in any place of the path, maybe several times. If the path begins with a slash, it is considered to be an absolute path, that is, the directory changes to the specified one, starting from the root. If the parameter begins with a directory name (or ".."), it is considered to be a relative path, that is, the directory changes to the specified directory, starting from the current one.

>The command pwd should display the absolute path to the current directory. This path must not contain "..".

>Initially, the current directory is the root. All directories mentioned explicitly or passed indirectly within any command cd are considered to exist. It is guaranteed that there is no attempt of transition to the parent directory of the root directory.

>**Input**<br>
The first line of the input data contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of commands.

>Then follow n lines, each contains one command. Each of these lines contains either command pwd, or command cd, followed by a space-separated non-empty parameter.

>The command parameter cd only contains lower case Latin letters, slashes and dots, two slashes cannot go consecutively, dots occur only as the name of a parent pseudo-directory. The command parameter cd does not end with a slash, except when it is the only symbol that points to the root directory. The command parameter has a length from 1 to 200 characters, inclusive.

>Directories in the file system can have the same names.

>**Output**<br>
For each command pwd you should print the full absolute path of the given directory, ending with a slash. It should start with a slash and contain the list of slash-separated directories in the order of being nested from the root to the current folder. It should contain no dots.

# 339B Xenia and Ringroad

>Xenia lives in a city that has n houses built along the main ringroad. The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.

>Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.

>**Input**<br>
The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10**5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10**5). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.

>**Output**<br>
Print a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.

>Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

>**Note**<br>
In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.

# 230A Dragons

>Kirito is stuck on a level of the MMORPG he is playing now. To move on in the game, he's got to defeat all n dragons that live on this level. Kirito and the dragons have strength, which is represented by an integer. In the duel between two opponents the duel's outcome is determined by their strength. Initially, Kirito's strength equals s.

>If Kirito starts duelling with the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) dragon and Kirito's strength is not greater than the dragon's strength xi, then Kirito loses the duel and dies. But if Kirito's strength is greater than the dragon's strength, then he defeats the dragon and gets a bonus strength increase by yi.

>Kirito can fight the dragons in any order. Determine whether he can move on to the next level of the game, that is, defeat all dragons without a single loss.

>**Input**<br>
The first line contains two space-separated integers s and n (1 ≤ s ≤ 10\*\*4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10\*\*3). Then n lines follow: the i-th line contains space-separated integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 10\*\*4, 0 ≤ yi ≤ 10\*\*4) — the i-th dragon's strength and the bonus for defeating it.

>**Output**<br>
On a single line print "YES" (without the quotes), if Kirito can move on to the next level and print "NO" (without the quotes), if he can't.

>**Note**<br>
In the first sample Kirito's strength initially equals 2. As the first dragon's strength is less than 2, Kirito can fight it and defeat it. After that he gets the bonus and his strength increases to 2 + 99 = 101. Now he can defeat the second dragon and move on to the next level.

>In the second sample Kirito's strength is too small to defeat the only dragon and win.

# 334A Candy Bags

>Gerald has n younger brothers and their number happens to be even. One day he bought n\*\*2 candy bags. One bag has one candy, one bag has two candies, one bag has three candies and so on. In fact, for each integer k from 1 to n\*\*2 he has exactly one bag with k candies.

>Help him give n bags of candies to each brother so that all brothers got the same number of candies.

>**Input**<br>
The single line contains a single integer n (n is even, 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Gerald's brothers.

>**Output**<br>
Let's assume that Gerald indexes his brothers with numbers from 1 to n. You need to print n lines, on the i-th line print n integers — the numbers of candies in the bags for the i-th brother. Naturally, all these numbers should be distinct and be within limits from 1 to n\*\*2. You can print the numbers in the lines in any order.

>It is guaranteed that the solution exists at the given limits.

>**Note**<br>
The sample shows Gerald's actions if he has two brothers. In this case, his bags contain 1, 2, 3 and 4 candies. He can give the bags with 1 and 4 candies to one brother and the bags with 2 and 3 to the other brother.

# 318A Even Odds

>Being a nonconformist, Volodya is displeased with the current state of things, particularly with the order of natural numbers (natural number is positive integer number). He is determined to rearrange them. But there are too many natural numbers, so Volodya decided to start with the first n. He writes down the following sequence of numbers: firstly all odd integers from 1 to n (in ascending order), then all even integers from 1 to n (also in ascending order). Help our hero to find out which number will stand at the position number k.

>**Input**<br>
The only line of input contains integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10**12).

>Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

>**Output**<br>
Print the number that will stand at the position number k after Volodya's manipulations.

>**Note**<br>
In the first sample Volodya's sequence will look like this: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The third place in the sequence is therefore occupied by the number 5.

# 337A Puzzles

>The end of the school year is near and Ms. Manana, the teacher, will soon have to say goodbye to a yet another class. She decided to prepare a goodbye present for her n students and give each of them a jigsaw puzzle (which, as wikipedia states, is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, often oddly shaped, interlocking and tessellating pieces).

>The shop assistant told the teacher that there are m puzzles in the shop, but they might differ in difficulty and size. Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists of f1 pieces, the second one consists of f2 pieces and so on.

>Ms. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible. Let A be the number of pieces in the largest puzzle that the teacher buys and B be the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. She wants to choose such n puzzles that A - B is minimum possible. Help the teacher and find the least possible value of A - B.

>**Input**<br>
The first line contains space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 50). The second line contains m space-separated integers f1, f2, ..., fm (4 ≤ fi ≤ 1000) — the quantities of pieces in the puzzles sold in the shop.

>**Output**<br>
Print a single integer — the least possible difference the teacher can obtain.

>**Note**<br>
Sample 1. The class has 4 students. The shop sells 6 puzzles. If Ms. Manana buys the first four puzzles consisting of 10, 12, 10 and 7 pieces correspondingly, then the difference between the sizes of the largest and the smallest puzzle will be equal to 5. It is impossible to obtain a smaller difference. Note that the teacher can also buy puzzles 1, 3, 4 and 5 to obtain the difference 5.

# 158D Ice Sculptures

>The Berland University is preparing to celebrate the 256-th anniversary of its founding! A specially appointed Vice Rector for the celebration prepares to decorate the campus. In the center of the campus n ice sculptures were erected. The sculptures are arranged in a circle at equal distances from each other, so they form a regular n-gon. They are numbered in clockwise order with numbers from 1 to n.

>The site of the University has already conducted a voting that estimated each sculpture's characteristic of ti — the degree of the sculpture's attractiveness. The values of ti can be positive, negative or zero.

>When the university rector came to evaluate the work, he said that this might be not the perfect arrangement. He suggested to melt some of the sculptures so that:

>the remaining sculptures form a regular polygon (the number of vertices should be between 3 and n),
the sum of the ti values of the remaining sculptures is maximized.
Help the Vice Rector to analyze the criticism — find the maximum value of ti sum which can be obtained in this way. It is allowed not to melt any sculptures at all. The sculptures can not be moved.

>**Input**<br>
The first input line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 20000) — the initial number of sculptures. The second line contains a sequence of integers t1, t2, ..., tn, ti — the degree of the i-th sculpture's attractiveness ( - 1000 ≤ ti ≤ 1000). The numbers on the line are separated by spaces.

>**Output**<br>
Print the required maximum sum of the sculptures' attractiveness.

>**Note**<br>
In the first sample it is best to leave every second sculpture, that is, leave sculptures with attractivenesses: 2, 4, 5 и 3.

# 276A Lunch Rush

>Having written another programming contest, three Rabbits decided to grab some lunch. The coach gave the team exactly k time units for the lunch break.

>The Rabbits have a list of n restaurants to lunch in: the i-th restaurant is characterized by two integers fi and ti. Value ti shows the time the Rabbits need to lunch in the i-th restaurant. If time ti exceeds the time k that the coach has given for the lunch break, then the Rabbits' joy from lunching in this restaurant will equal fi - (ti - k). Otherwise, the Rabbits get exactly fi units of joy.

>Your task is to find the value of the maximum joy the Rabbits can get from the lunch, depending on the restaurant. The Rabbits must choose exactly one restaurant to lunch in. Note that the joy value isn't necessarily a positive value.

>**Input**<br>
The first line contains two space-separated integers — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10**4) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10**9) — the number of restaurants in the Rabbits' list and the time the coach has given them to lunch, correspondingly. Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers — fi (1 ≤ fi ≤ 10**9) and ti (1 ≤ ti ≤ 10**9) — the characteristics of the i-th restaurant.

>**Output**<br>
In a single line print a single integer — the maximum joy value that the Rabbits will get from the lunch.
